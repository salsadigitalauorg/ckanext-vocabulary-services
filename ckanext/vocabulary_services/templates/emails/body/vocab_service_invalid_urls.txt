The Ecosciences.Qld Data Catalogue automatically checks for updates of controlled vocabularies, according to their update frequencies.

The following vocabulary service(s) could not be updated:

{% for service in invalid_services %}
{% set service_url = h.url_for('vocabulary_services.index', id=service.name, _external=True) %}
Vocabulary service: {{service.title}} {{service_url}}
URI: {{service.uri}}
Update date: {{h.qdes_render_date_with_offset(current_utc)}}
{% endfor %}

The URI/URL may no longer be valid or the service may have been temporarily unavailable during the update process.

Please review the vocabulary service details and update the invalid URI/URL if required.
